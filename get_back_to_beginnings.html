                            1. You are worried about compatibility with the existing system.
                            <br/><br/>
                            2.
                            <br/><br/>
                            3. Existing developers have forgotten what a lot of the code does. They are afraid that
                            changes will worsen the system, new developers take too long to train. So hiring an army of
                            developer can't save you from bad code. And every day the system accumulates more bad code.
                            <br/><br/>
                            4. The business becomes hostage of the code state. Slower development costs time and money,
                            unpredictable integration periods make it harder to make sales promises, and quirky bugs can
                            make your customers lose faith.

                            your profession, defend your code quality. Your managers actually want better code - they
                            want to make it easier to develop new features. If some managers push you to write bad
                            code tell them story about american navy and canadian lighthouse. You should be like
                            lighthouse - you are defending your product - your code
                            <br/><br/>
                            Whose fault is bad code?
                            Managers job = defend schedule and features
                            Our job = defend the code
                            It is our responsibility to say “NO“ and provide good code

                        <aside class="notes">
                            In software development we are almost always constrained by a deadline. The pressure is on
                            and we feel rushed to get the work done. We don’t take the time to step back and think about
                            the quality of our code or whether we are adhering to any design principles that are
                            appropriate to the programming paradigm in which we are working. This can result in sloppy
                            code and the accumulation of Technical Debt that we will “clear later”. Of course, later
                            usually means never.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Sometimes it is simply lack of knowledge that prevents us from writing good code. In this
                            case the solution is to get that knowledge but not all developer’s want it. Our jobs as
                            professionals and colleagues is to persuade them that the knowledge will be worth it.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Psychology tells us that our environment shapes our behaviour so we can’t expect a developer
                            to actively apply a set of principles independently of her environment. What do I mean by
                            this? I am referring to the effect that morale and organisational ‘red-tape’ has on a
                            developer’s ability to code. If a developer is unmotivated or constrained by strict policies
                            then he may have no desire to write well-designed code.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Another factor that affects a developer’s environment is the availability of competent and
                            more experienced developers. When developer’s have access to more experienced senior
                            developers a mentoring culture can emerge and the quality of code can improve through
                            practices such as code reviews and pair programming.

                            The choice-supportive bias tells us that when we make a choice we tend to feel positive
                            about it even if it has flaws. It implies that when we choose a particular design we fail to
                            see its weaknesses or downplay them because we chose that design. This is related to the IKEA
                            effect, a cognitive bias that occurs when people place a disproportionately high value on a
                            product that they partially created. If we spent a long time and effort hand-crafting a set
                            of inheritance-based classes then boy are we going to feel positive about them! Our memory
                            of the choices we made along the way are distorted and our brain chooses to remember the
                            positive rather than the negative aspects. Research has shown that the more cognitive
                            load and decision-making we are tasked with, the greater the likelihood of us being
                            affected by the choice-supportive bias. So activities like coding are particular
                            susceptible. We need to be careful that we aren’t seeing our designs through
                            rose-tinted glasses by seeking out the opinions of others and through code reviews
                            and pair-programming.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Priming is an unconscious memory effect in which exposure to one stimulus influences
                            our response to another stimulus. For instance, if a person reads a list of words that
                            includes the word ‘computer’, and is later asked to state a word that begins with
                            ‘com…’, the probability that he or she will answer ‘computer’ is greater than if they are
                            not primed. When we are exposed to an existing codebase with a ‘bad’ design we are
                            more likely to repeat those patterns elsewhere in the code. It can be useful to
                            perform a constructive critique of an existing codebase and to discuss the design with other
                            developers before jumping straight into coding. If the outcome of such discussion involves
                            any redesign then we will then be primed to make positive changes rather than unconsciously
                            re-apply bad design. Priming is exacerbated by Informational Conformity.
                            <br/><br/>
                            When reading perplexing code it is sometimes possible to think that the developer that wrote
                            it ‘knows something that we don’t’. Based on this assumption we adhere to the current
                            behaviour of the code because we’re unsure of how to change it. Essentially, we copy existing
                            code even if we know it sucks. An example of Informational Conformity is not writing unit tests
                            simply because none exist currently. If we are unsure about why the code has been written in
                            a certain way then we should ask the developer that wrote it, if they are available.
                            Otherwise we should talk to our peers and discuss alternative designs or approaches to
                            make the design cleaner and more coherent.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Closely related to Informational Conformity is the Halo effect. We take the code written by
                            a developer that we perceive as more competent than us as having a good design even if that
                            code is bad. We consequently fail to challenge or change it and we even copy it. Imitation
                            is the sincerest form of flattery of course. This effect also applies to our own code.  We
                            take one positive aspect and associate it with the entire code base. We ignore the flaws of
                            our code because the service we created to retrieve customer data is pretty awesome! We also
                            need to be careful we don’t apply the reverse-halo affect by dismissing ideas from developers
                            that we perceive as less competent. We need to remember that everybody has something to
                            contribute.
                            <br/><br/>
                            As a developer we act in favour of the present state of the code over investing in the future,
                            i.e. refactoring into a better design because we want the reward of it being finished now.
                            This effect is compounded by the fact that we suffer from another cognitive bias: procrastination.
                            We will remove that duplication later! Moreover, the Principle of Least Effort tells us that
                            we are inherently lazy. If there are several ways of achieving the same goal, we will opt
                            for the least demanding course of action. This usually means avoiding refactoring.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Reactance occurs when we feel that someone or something is taking away our choices or limiting
                            the range of alternatives available to us. So we do the opposite of what the rules (or principles)
                            suggest to prove our freedom of choice. We ignore software design principles because we want
                            to do our own thing. This bias can make us commit to an opinion more strongly when we are
                            challenged or pressured to adopt another viewpoint. Sometimes our responses are justified but
                            sometimes we may just be being irrational.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Have you ever worked with a developer that grossly over-estimates their own technical ability?
                            The Dunning-Kruger effect occurs when people fail to adequately assess their level of competence
                            at a task and thus consider themselves more skilled than everyone else. Not only this but
                            they also fail to recognize genuine competence in other people. The opposite is also true.
                            Competent people will underestimate their ability compared with others. This is known as the
                            imposter syndrome. When people are exposed to training they do then recognize and acknowledge
                            their own personal previous lack of skill. We don’t know how incompetent we are until we are

                            Let me explain how you can easily make your code less confusing, cleaner and better. Most
                            books and courses about clean code start with an explanation of the design patterns or
                            writing tests. But these are just tools. If you don't understand the underlying motivation to
                            use these tools, they will not help you very much.
                            <br/>
                            Don't be intimidated by the thought of learning something new. Writing clean code is a skill
                            like any other, you have to spend some time studying as well as practicing it.
                            <br/>
                            Professional code isn't about creating the perfect code. It's not possible! There's no such
                            thing. Professional code is about accepting that fact. All software has bugs. Every line of
                            code is subject to change. If you write clean code, you are trying to make it easy to find
                            and fix those bugs and you are writing code that is easy to understand and change.

                            The team who designed the ALGOL language—the granddaddy of most modern languages and one
                            of the most influential languages ever—received the following advice: “The best is the enemy
                            of the good.” Working toward perfection might prevent completion. Complete it first, and
                            then perfect it. The part that needs to be perfect is usually small.

                            Personal experience - when I started writing tests I also started writing better code because
                            I could not test bad code and when you write piece of bad code and code that is not designed
                            properly you will notice it immediately in your tests.

                            the code will break it". Good tests are also kind of good documentation.

                            Most software defects are introduced when changing existing code. Developer can't fully grasp
                            the effects of the changes made. Developer should be confident that the changes do not
                            break any existing functionality

                            Good syntax is understandable syntax. Understandable syntax normally doesn't look like code.
                            Code is cryptic and unnatural to follow. Instead, understandable syntax should look like English.
                            English is easier to read, is easier to talk and reason verbally, and most importantly, it can
                            encourage the developer to understand business requirements. If your code is starting to look

                            Your goal is to write beautiful, functional and verbose code. In the words of Uncle Bob "your
                            code should read like an article. There should be a beginning, middle and end, it should be
                            self-documenting and should follow a logical order. By using verbose and purposeful wording you
                            can ensure that your code is self-explanatory.

                            Many developers are tempted to rewrite rather than do the hard work of reading and
                            comprehending existing code. Since reading code is naturally challenging, if you write code
                            that you’re barely able to follow as you write it, you’ll find you’re unable to comprehend it
                            all later. Professional developers write so much code that after a few weeks of separation,
                            most the structure and design decisions fall out of memory. It’s like looking at the project

                            “Clean code is code that has been taken care of. Someone has taken the time to keep it simple and
                            orderly. They have paid appropriate attention to details. They have cared. But why should you care?
                            What’s wrong with code that just works? You should care because code is (almost) never written
                            just once and then forgotten. Most of the time you, or someone else, need to work on the code.
                            And to be able to work on it efficiently you need to understand the code. And because people
                            need to understand the code we write, we can say that the code we write is not intended
                            only for the computer but also for humans.
                            <br/><br/>
                            If your code is well design, clean and elegant than everyone will take care of it also. No one
                            will try to make mess in that code.

                            Complexity always grows over time. It’s the unavoidable consequence of maturing software.
                            Programming has to become the act of reducing complexity to simplicity.Other- wise, nobody
                            could keep working on a program after it reached a certain level of complexity. The complex
                            pieces of a program have to be organized in some simple way so that a programmer can work on
                            it without having God-like mental abilities. - Source - Code Simplicity

                            When details become egregiously hard to code, it may be a smell that the actual function of
                            the system is difficult to understand. And while you may pat yourself on the back for
                            successfully programming something really complex, others are punching you in the back after
                            they use it.

                            Some developers spend more time debugging than writing new code. They should do this
                            efficiently.

                            Debug a program was minimized when variables had names that averaged 10 to 16 characters.
                            Programs with names averaging 8 to 20 characters were almost as easy to debug. The guideline
                            doesn’t mean that you should try to make all of your variable names 9 to 15 or 10 to 16
                            characters long. It does mean that if you look over your code and see many names that are
                            shorter, you should check to be sure that the names are as clear as they need to be. - Code

                                Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we

                            It's like learning to ride bicycle from the book or learning to fight watching Bruce Lee movies.
                            It's impossible to learn to code just from to book. You learn all the time. As Uncle Bob Martin
                            said in his book "You must sweat over it". You have to write the code, you have to think about it,
                            you have to hate it, hate yourself because you fail. Head up, refactor your code, shine for the
                            moment, enjoy the fact that you are brilliant mastermind and yet again watch yourself failing.
                            Read your code, read other peoples code. Maybe someone is born with code-sense but most of the time
                            it's not. Talented football player is not the best football player. The best player is one who
                            trained a lot every day.
                            <br/><br/>
                            You have to write code - You have to read code
                            <br/><br/>
                            Do not only learn and analyse - Get you hands dirty. Failure is the only source of experience -
                            success is side effect. Experience is the only source of intuition

                            Modern programming languages, frameworks and APIs have powerful means to create sophisticated
                            solutions for various kinds of problems. Sometimes developers might feel tempted to write
                            “clever” solutions that use all these complex features. The KISS principle states that a
                            solution is better when it uses less inheritance, less polymorphism, fewer classes, etc.
                            This does not mean that features like inheritance and polymorphism should not be used at all.
                            Rather they should only be used when they are necessary or there is some substantial advantage
                            in using them.

                            Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in
                            the future.

                            YAGNI prevents speculative development

                            You actually might need the code in the future, but since you can’t predict the future you
                            don’t know how the code needs to work yet. If you write it now, before you need it, you’re
                            going to have to redesign it for your real needs once you actually start using it. So save
                            yourself that redesign time, and simply wait until you need the code before you write it.
                            Another risk of writing code before you need it is that unused code tends to develop
                            “bit rot.” Since the code never runs, it might slowly become out of sync with the rest of
                            your system and thus develop bugs, and you’ll never know. Then, when you start to use it,
                            you’ll have to spend time debugging it.
                            <br/><br/>
                            There are lots of reasons people think that they should write code before it’s needed, or
                            keep around code that isn’t being used. First off, some people believe they can get around
                            the Law of Change by programming every feature that any user could ever possibly need, right
                            now. Then, they think, the program won’t have to be changed or improved in the future. But
                            this is wrong. It’s not possible to write a system that will never change, as long as that
                            system continues to have users. Others believe that they are saving themselves time in the
                            future by doing some extra work now. In some cases that philosophy works, but not when
                            you’re writing code that isn’t needed. Even if that code ends up being needed in the future,
                            you will almost certainly have to spend time redesigning it, so you’re actually wasting time.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Anticipating logic in the future, more often than not, will lead to unintended complexity.
                            <br/><br/>

                            You can easily understand code if you choose names carefully.
                            Choosing good names takes time but it gives more value than it gets. Remember that
                            code is 10x more read than written.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Readability is top priority
                            Code is written for humans to read and to be executed by machine. Machine will execute your code
                            but ask yourself - can human understand this
                            Read your when you finish writing - if it is funny or not clear to your colleagues
                            do refactoring.
                            When you read entity name you should not be surprised of it's responsibilities

                            Name should be meaningful

                            <br/><br/>

                            You will read code many many times but write only once.

                            Worse than meaningless name is misleading name.

                            It’s impossible to write clean and easily understandable code unless you are good at naming
                            variables, methods, classes, and anything else that you create which requires a name.

                            First invent the name of the class and then start writing the code. The name will help you
                            keep focused on the purpose of your class and the code will be better. If you don't have any
                            idea how to name it, maybe you need two or three more specialized classes. And don't be
                            afraid to change the name if you have better idea.

                            1. Do not use unnecessary, unclear abbreviations. Pronounceable names can be talked about
                            easily. Don't abbreviate unnecessarily.
                            <br/><br/>

                            3. Avoid using variables with short names. Exception are variables used for loops. Bu if you
                            use nested loops these variables are not recommended. You can also use subroutines instead
                            of nested loops.
                            <br/><br/>
                            4. A study by W. J. Hansen found that longer names are better for rarely used variables or global
                            variables and shorter names are better for local variables or loop variables (Shneiderman 1980)

                            8. Most of the variables in your program are temporary. Calling a few of them temporary may
                            indicate that you aren’t sure of their real pur- poses. - Code complete

                            The ideal number of params is 0 - niladic functions

                            3 - Triadic - should be avoided
                            4 and more params - Polyadic - Think about rewriting your function (T. Otwel)
                            Try to pass object instead creating polyadic functions
                            <br/><br/>
                            If you use try-catch - than it should be the only one block in function
                            One level abstraction bellow name of the functions

                            Functions should not have side effects - do only one thing in functions - what name of that
                            function is - no more no less. Side effects - do only one thing - described in name - not
                            sudden effects. You know you are working on clean code when each routine turns out to be

                            If you don’t maintain it, your code can rot. And it can also die. Dead code is code that is
                            never run, that can never be reached. That has no life. Tell your code to get a life, or get
                            lost. Do not afraid - source control is your friend!
                            <br/><br/>
                            2. <br/>
                            Functions generally either process or retrieve things. If they are doing both,
                            they are doing too many things. What functions retrieve can be described by the
                            function name.
                            <br/><br/>
                            3. <br/>
                            Try to make it obvious what the parameters and their order is from the function name.
                            Also keep order consistent, so if you usually ask for $user_id as the first parameter,
                            keep it as the first parameter in future function definitions.

                            $database->update_user_email($user_id, $email);
                            $database->update_user_first_name($user_id, $first_name);

                            Noun or noun phrase best describes what responsibilities it fulfills
                            <br/><br/>
                            The first rule of classes is that they should be small. The second rule of classes is that
                            they should be smaller than that. We are actually counting number of responsibilities
                            <br/><br/>
                            We should also be able to write a brief description of the class in about 25 words,
                            without using the words “if,” “and,” “or,” or “but.”
                            <br/><br/>
                            Do not break SRP. They should be organized for change.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Two classes, components or modules are coupled when at least one of them uses the other. The
                            less these items know about each other, the looser they are coupled. A component that is only
                            loosely coupled to its environment can be more easily changed or replaced than a strongly
                            coupled component. If they are tightly coupled they will become hard to change.
                            <br/><br/>
                            We can look at object oriented software as a bunch of classes that send messages (call
                            functions) between each other. Whenever a class sends a message to another class or receives
                            a message, there is a relationship between those classes. We can't simply change or delete
                            the class receiving the message because it would break the other one. So we have to change
                            both at the same time. The more widely the class is used, the more changes in the rest of
                            the program we have to carry out when we need to change its behaviour. This is why we have
                            to be careful when designing relationships between our classes.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Cohesion is measure of whether responsibilities form meaningful unit.
                            Cohesion is the degree to which elements of a whole belong together. Methods and fields in a
                            single class and classes of a component should have high cohesion. High cohesion in classes
                            and components results in simpler, more easily understandable code structure and design.

                            to remember that the code you write is not only for compilers but for programmers too.
                            Eventually your code will become someone else's code and you will, in turn, inherit someone

                            With too many comments, you may face the following issues:
                            1. Time consuming maintenance that may lead to comments that are no longer up to date. Then
                            comments go against their primary goal: they mislead the developer who will spend more time
                            understanding the source code.
                            2. If the source code needs too many comments, it either means that it does not respect coding
                            standards (naming conventions, design, etc.) or it is too complex.

                                "How can I improve the code so this comment isn't needed?"

                            1. For example do not write comments about information that can be found in source control

                            2. Comments tend to be obsolete - comments easily become old, non appropriate

                            4. If you really want to write comment than let it be worth and good. Let it be clear.
                            Don’t comment on facts that can be derived quickly from the code itself.

                            6. DO NOT leave commented out piece of code NEVER. Please never - if you do not do this it
                            will stay there forever. You will write it better next time trust me :-)

                            All this comments creates "noise". Even if there is a comment that could help you in
                            troubleshooting or fixing something, there is a very good chance that you will miss it
                            because it's obfuscated by the noise. - Source https://cmatskas.com/comments-in-code-yay-or-nay/

                            The word “refactoring” in modern programming grew out of Larry Constantine’s original use of
                            the word “factoring” in structured programming, which referred to decomposing a program into
                            its constituent parts as much as possible (Yourdon and Constantine 1979). - Code Complete
                            Start with bunch of code and than refactor

                            Adam Culp - “I write a novel and I make news article later in refactoring"

                            Refactoring Happens Now or Never.
                            First write code that works - than do refactoring. Refine your code, split out functions,
                            make it dry, make it more readable. First make it work than make it wright.

                            Refactoring increases ease of change while reducing risk of change

                            Do not rewrite application just to clean code and application will remain the same
                            - refactor it
                            <br/><br/>
                            Frequently in software development, we solve a problem, check in the code and release it.
                            Unfortunately, this means that we release the first draft of our solution. One of the main
                            lessons of writing workshops and classes is to write in small chunks .and revise ruthlessly.
                            By releasing our first drafts, we increase the maintenance cost of our application by making
                            it harder for the next developer to understand the initial intent of the our solution. In
                            this session, we will explore concepts from the craft of writing such as small assignments,
                            shitty first drafts, where ideas come from and the three types of drafts as they apply to
                            the practice of software development. - Alan Stevens

                            You never know as much when you begin writing a program as you do afterward. When you have
                            a chance to revise a program, use what you’ve learned to improve it. - Code Complete

                            One day, a tapestry that was hanging a little too close to his living room fireplace caught on
                            fire. The fire department rushed in to save the day—and his house. But before they dragged
                            their big, dirty hoses into the house, they stopped—with the fire raging—to roll out a mat
                            between the front door and the source of the fire. They didn't want to mess up the carpet.
