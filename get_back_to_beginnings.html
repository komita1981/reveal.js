                            Write a code like guy who will maintain it knows where you live and he is psyho
                            Treat your code as valuable member of the team. Like member of the management can screw
                            up - code can do it also if it is messy. Hiring an army of developer can't save you from
                            bad code. Try to write it as good as possible. Do not say to yourself I will do it next
                            time - LeBlanc's law says - Later equals never. Bad code is your mistake. Not managers -
                            only yours. It's your job to defend your code - like doctor who is washing his hands before
                            surgery. It takes time but it is your duty. Your job as professional is to say no. Defend
                            your profession, defend your code quality.
                            Deadline is not excuse. Making mess is very unprofessional.
                            If you make mess you will never reach that deadline.
                            The only way to go fast is to keep code clean as much as possible
                            all the time. Imagine you code is building. What happens with building when you stop caring
                            about it. The same happens to the code.
                            Code is getting worse as time passes. We should not wait - fix it all the time. That's
                            the only way you can prevent degradation.

                            Your managers actually want better code - they want to make it easier to develop new features

                            Take care about all parts of your application - bugs are often hidden in ignored parts

                            Entropy hits us hart. Entropy is amount of disorder in system.

                            Speak about broken window problem

                            Dont leave bad code behind you. Fix them as soon as you discover it. If you think there is
                            not enough time and that someone else will go around cleaning this mess - you are so wrong.
                            Dont let entropy wins - clean your code - clean it now

                            1. Testable system passes all tests and is completely tested. System that are not testable should
                            not be deployed because they can't be verified. Personal experience - when I started writing tests
                            I also started writing better code because I could not test bad code and when you write piece of
                            bad code and code that is not designed properly you will notice it immediately in your tests.
                            Encourage SRP and DIP. "The fact that we have these tests eliminates the fear that cleaning up
                            the code will break it". Good tests are also kind of good documentation
                            <br/>
                            2. Evil of every system. DRY - Dont repeat yourself
                            <br/>
                            3. Code should express all designs ideas that are in system. Think about maintenance - if your code
                            reveal your intent people who work after you on that code will spend less time. Some desing patterns
                            solve this problem - Every time you duplicate your code you should create some kind of abstraction
                            Template, Strategy or Visitor pattern. Use if/else and switch case carefully
                            <br/>
                            4. Minimizes the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions, and the like.

                        Read 10x more than write. We are constantly reading old code. If you want to write code
                        more quickly that means that you have to make it more readable. Easy to read is easy to write.
                        "It's OK to figure out murder mysteries, but you shouldn't need to figure out code. You should
                        be able to read it" - Steve C McConnell. It has story to tell.
                        <br/>
                        Clean
                        <br/>
                        Someone cared about it
                        <br/>
                        Simple
                        <br/>
                        Understand what it does
                        <br/>
                        Extandable
                        <br/>
                        Able to solve upcoming problem
                        <br/>
                        Efficient
                        <br/>
                        Able to solve upcoming problem

                        If your code is well design, clean and elegant than everyone will take care of it also. No one
                        will try to make mess in that code.

                        Tell story about fire in beautiful house - fireman care about house - they pout something
                        beneath hoses

                        Good code is solid, well written, tested and documented.

                        Clever is the enemy of clear.

                        Knowledge<br/>

                        As developer we collect, organize and maintain knowledge. You have to learn basics of software
                        architecture and design patterns, follow good good practice and principles. You have to read a
                        lot, you have to read every day. Follow people with high knowledge, listen to them, read their books.
                        Go to conferences, speak about programming with your colleagues. Do it as often as it possible.
                        <br/><br/>

                        Hard work<br/>

                        It's like learning to ride bicycle from the book or learning to fight watching Bruce Lee movies.
                        It's impossible to learn to code just from to book. You learn all the time. As Uncle Bob Martin
                        said in his book "You must sweat over it". You have to write the code, you have to think about it,
                        you have to hate it, hate yourself because you fail. Head up, refactor your code, shine for the
                        moment, enjoy the fact that you are brilliant mastermind and yet again watch yourself failing.
                        Read your code, read other peoples code. Maybe someone is born with code-sense but most of the time
                        it's not. Talented football player is not the best football player. The best player is one who
                        trained a lot every day.

                        You can easily understand code if you choose names carefully.
                        Choosing good names takes time but it gives more value than it gets. Remember that
                        code is 10x more read than written.<br/><br/>
                        Readability is top priority
                        Code is written for humans to read and to be executed by machine. Machine will execute your code
                        but ask yourself - can human understand this
                        Read your when you finish writing - if it is funny or not clear to your colleagues
                        do refactoring.
                        When you read entity name you should not be surprised of it's responsibilities

                        Name should be meaningful

                        <br/><br/>

                        You will read code many many times but write only once.

                        Worse than meaningless name is misleading name.

                        Itâ€™s impossible to write clean and easily understandable code unless you are good at naming
                        variables, methods, classes, and anything else that you create which requires a name.

                            I also prefer this in all other loops
                            Functions should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only. (Clean Code)
                            Functions should not have side effects - do in functions only one thing - what name of that

                            If you use try-catch - than it should be the only one block in function

                            Choosing good nae is important - remember that you read 10x more than you write
                            The ideal number of params is 0 - niladic functions
                            Next come with 1 param - monadic
                            Followed by 2 - dyadic
                            3 - Triadic - should be avoided
                            4 and more params - Polyadic - Think about rewriting your function (T. Otwel)
                            Try to pass object instead creating polyadic functions

                            Side effects - do only one thing - described in name - not sudden effects

                            They are often source of lie. That's because if you have a lot of comments you have to maintain
                            them as you maintain your .

                            Code should have comments, but having too much comments is as bad as too few. Comments discuss
                            why something is done but it' already explained in code - it DRY break

                            Speak about using PHPdoc and writing comments in files describing variables and methods
                            Speak about my preferable way of documenting even it is not pragmatic - writing doc block
                            for protected methods and variables and header in every file

                            Comments should only really be written when itâ€™s not possible to clearly communicate the intent
                            of a variable or method by using a name. The comment then serves an actual purpose that could
                            not be easily expressed in the code. - simpleprogrammer.com/2015/03/16/11-rules-all-programmers-should-live-by/

                            1. For example do not write comments about information that can be found in source control
                            <br/>
                            2. Comments tend to be obsolete - comments easily become old, non appropriate
                            <br/>
                            3. For example - $i++ - increment i
                            <br/>
                            4. If you really want to write comment than let it be worth and good. Let it be clear.
                            <br/>
                            5. DO NOT leave commented out piece of code NEVER. Please never - if you do not do this it
                            will stay there forever. You will write it better next time trust me :-)

                            interface definition. Programmer should understand what it does, why it does it and how it does
                            it in less than 30 seconds. This can be achieved if there is informative header documentation,
                            a name that clearly conveys the intent, by doing what it is supposed to - no more no less.
