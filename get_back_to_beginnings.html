                            2.

                            3. Existing developers have forgotten what a lot of the code does. They are afraid that
                            changes will worsen the system, new developers take too long to train. So hiring an army of
                            developer can't save you from bad code. And every day the system accumulates more bad code.

                            4. Slower development costs time and money, unpredictable integration periods make it harder
                            to make sales promises, and quirky bugs can make your customers lose faith.

                            your profession, defend your code quality. Your managers actually want better code - they
                            want to make it easier to develop new features. If some managers push you to write bad
                            code tell them story about american navy and canadian lighthouse. You should be like

                            Deadline is not excuse. Making mess is very unprofessional. The only way to go fast is
                            to keep code clean as much as possible all the time.

                            Don't leave bad code behind you. Fix them as soon as you discover it. If you think there is
                            not enough time and that someone else will go around cleaning this mess - you are so wrong.

                            Additional story
                            Everyone knows the previous co-worker whose name became a verb to describe dirty code.
                            “Oh man, this code has been Jimmy’d.”
                            Ouch. Comments like this are the kiss of death for long-term employment prospects. We want
                            our co-workers to recommend and hire us in future positions, right? Being known for writing
                            clean code is a great way to assure your co-workers recommend you and look forward to working
                            with both you and your code in the future.

                            In software development we are almost always constrained by a deadline. The pressure is on
                            and we feel rushed to get the work done. We don’t take the time to step back and think about
                            the quality of our code or whether we are adhering to any design principles that are
                            appropriate to the programming paradigm in which we are working. This can result in sloppy
                            code and the accumulation of Technical Debt that we will “clear later”. Of course, later
                            usually means never.

                            Sometimes it is simply lack of knowledge that prevents us from writing good code. In this
                            case the solution is to get that knowledge but not all developer’s want it. Our jobs as
                            professionals and colleagues is to persuade them that the knowledge will be worth it.

                            Psychology tells us that our environment shapes our behaviour so we can’t expect a developer
                            to actively apply a set of principles independently of her environment. What do I mean by
                            this? I am referring to the effect that morale and organisational ‘red-tape’ has on a
                            developer’s ability to code. If a developer is unmotivated or constrained by strict policies
                            then he may have no desire to write well-designed code.

                            Another factor that affects a developer’s environment is the availability of competent and
                            more experienced developers. When developer’s have access to more experienced senior
                            developers a mentoring culture can emerge and the quality of code can improve through
                            practices such as code reviews and pair programming.

                            The choice-supportive bias tells us that when we make a choice we tend to feel positive
                            about it even if it has flaws. It implies that when we choose a particular design we fail to
                            see its weaknesses or downplay them because we chose that design. This is related to the IKEA
                            effect, a cognitive bias that occurs when people place a disproportionately high value on a
                            product that they partially created. If we spent a long time and effort hand-crafting a set
                            of  inheritance-based classes then boy are we going to feel positive about them! Our memory
                            of the choices we made along the way are distorted and our brain chooses to remember the
                            positive rather than the negative aspects. Research has shown that the more cognitive
                            load and decision-making we are tasked with, the greater the likelihood of us being
                            affected by the choice-supportive bias. So activities like coding are particular
                            susceptible. We need to be careful that we aren’t seeing our designs through
                            rose-tinted glasses by seeking out the opinions of others and through code reviews
                            and pair-programming.

                            Priming is an unconscious memory effect in which exposure to one stimulus influences
                            our response to another stimulus. For instance, if a person reads a list of words that
                            includes the word ‘computer’, and is later asked to state a word that begins with
                            ‘com…’, the probability that he or she will answer ‘computer’ is greater than if they are
                            not primed. When we are exposed to an existing codebase with a ‘bad’ design we are
                            more likely to repeat those patterns elsewhere in the code. It can be useful to
                            perform a constructive critique of an existing codebase and to discuss the design with other
                            developers before jumping straight into coding. If the outcome of such discussion involves
                            any redesign then we will then be primed to make positive changes rather than unconsciously
                            re-apply bad design. Priming is exacerbated by Informational Conformity.

                            When reading perplexing code it is sometimes possible to think that the developer that wrote
                            it ‘knows something that we don’t’. Based on this assumption we adhere to the current
                            behaviour of the code because we’re unsure of how to change it. Essentially, we copy existing
                            code even if we know it sucks. An example of Informational Conformity is not writing unit tests
                            simply because none exist currently. If we are unsure about why the code has been written in
                            a certain way then we should ask the developer that wrote it, if they are available.
                            Otherwise we should talk to our peers and discuss alternative designs or approaches to
                            make the design cleaner and more coherent.

                            Closely related to Informational Conformity is the Halo effect. We take the code written by
                            a developer that we perceive as more competent than us as having a good design even if that
                            code is bad. We consequently fail to challenge or change it and we even copy it. Imitation
                            is the sincerest form of flattery of course. This effect also applies to our own code.  We
                            take one positive aspect and associate it with the entire code base. We ignore the flaws of
                            our code because the service we created to retrieve customer data is pretty awesome! We also
                            need to be careful we don’t apply the reverse-halo affect by dismissing ideas from developers
                            that we perceive as less competent. We need to remember that everybody has something to
                            contribute.

                            As a developer we act in favour of the present state of the code over investing in the future,
                            i.e. refactoring into a better design because we want the reward of it being finished now.
                            This effect is compounded by the fact that we suffer from another cognitive bias: procrastination.
                            We will remove that duplication later! Moreover, the Principle of Least Effort tells us that
                            we are inherently lazy. If there are several ways of achieving the same goal, we will opt
                            for the least demanding course of action. This usually means avoiding refactoring.

                            Reactance occurs when we feel that someone or something is taking away our choices or limiting
                            the range of alternatives available to us. So we do the opposite of what the rules (or principles)
                            suggest to prove our freedom of choice. We ignore software design principles because we want
                            to do our own thing. This bias can make us commit to an opinion more strongly when we are
                            challenged or pressured to adopt another viewpoint. Sometimes our responses are justified but
                            sometimes we may just be being irrational.

                            Have you ever worked with a developer that grossly over-estimates their own technical ability?
                            The Dunning-Kruger effect occurs when people fail to adequately assess their level of competence
                            at a task and thus consider themselves more skilled than everyone else. Not only this but
                            they also fail to recognize genuine competence in other people. The opposite is also true.
                            Competent people will underestimate their ability compared with others. This is known as the
                            imposter syndrome. When people are exposed to training they do then recognize and acknowledge
                            their own personal previous lack of skill. We don’t know how incompetent we are until we are
                            given the skills or knowledge to realise what we don’t know. This is why training is so
                            important in software development.

                            Personal experience - when I started writing tests
                            I also started writing better code because I could not test bad code and when you write piece of
                            bad code and code that is not designed properly you will notice it immediately in your tests.
                            . "The fact that we have these tests eliminates the fear that cleaning up
                            the code will break it". Good tests are also kind of good documentation.

                            3. Code should express all designs ideas that are in system. Think about maintenance - if your code
                            reveal your intent people who work after you on that code will spend less time. Some design patterns
                            solve this problem - Every time you duplicate your code you should create some kind of abstraction
                            Template, Strategy or Visitor pattern. Use if/else and switch case carefully

                            It is much more profitable losing a couple of minutes thinking what is the best name for a
                            variable, or what is the best way to structure a class and get this extra time every time we
                            have to read it, than using the first name or structure that comes to mind in order to save time
                            having to spend it later trying to understand what a certain function does and how it does it.

                            Your code should read like a well-written story. The code should have a natural flow where each
                            method describes an operation that has an entry and exit point. Each method should add to the
                            overall story and written in such a way that it would make sense even to non-programmers

                            Good syntax is understandable syntax. Understandable syntax normally doesn't look like code.
                            Code is cryptic and unnatural to follow. Instead, understandable syntax should look like English.
                            English is easier to read, is easier to talk and reason verbally, and most importantly, it can
                            encourage the developer to understand business requirements. If your code is starting to look
                            less cryptic and more like English, that's a good sign. I will now run through a list of
                            bite-sized tips which will make it easier to write code like English.

                            Your goal is to write beautiful, functional and verbose code. In the words of Uncle Bob "your
                            code should read like an article. There should be a beginning, middle and end, it should be
                            self-documenting and should follow a logical order. By using verbose and purposeful wording you
                            can ensure that your code is self-explanatory.

                            Many developers are tempted to rewrite rather than do the hard work of reading and
                            comprehending existing code. Since reading code is naturally challenging, if you write code
                            that you’re barely able to follow as you write it, you’ll find you’re unable to comprehend it
                            all later. Professional developers write so much code that after a few weeks of separation,
                            most the structure and design decisions fall out of memory. It’s like looking at the project
                            with a fresh perspective. Not being able to understand your own code a few weeks later can
                            be a really depressing situation. Source - http://blog.pluralsight.com/7-reasons-clean-code-matters

                            “Clean code is code that has been taken care of. Someone has taken the time to keep it simple and
                            orderly. They have paid appropriate attention to details. They have cared. But why should you care?
                            What’s wrong with code that just works? You should care because code is (almost) never written
                            just once and then forgotten. Most of the time you, or someone else, need to work on the code.
                            And to be able to work on it efficiently you need to understand the code. And because people
                            need to understand the code we write, we can say that the code we write is not intended
                            only for the computer but also for humans.

                            If your code is well design, clean and elegant than everyone will take care of it also. No one
                            will try to make mess in that code.

                            shorter, you should check to be sure that the names are as clear as they need to be. - Code

                            It's like learning to ride bicycle from the book or learning to fight watching Bruce Lee movies.
                            It's impossible to learn to code just from to book. You learn all the time. As Uncle Bob Martin
                            said in his book "You must sweat over it". You have to write the code, you have to think about it,
                            you have to hate it, hate yourself because you fail. Head up, refactor your code, shine for the
                            moment, enjoy the fact that you are brilliant mastermind and yet again watch yourself failing.
                            Read your code, read other peoples code. Maybe someone is born with code-sense but most of the time
                            it's not. Talented football player is not the best football player. The best player is one who
                            trained a lot every day.

                            Read your when you finish writing - if it is funny or not clear to your colleagues
                            do refactoring.
                            When you read entity name you should not be surprised of it's responsibilities

                            Name should be meaningful

                            <br/><br/>

                            You will read code many many times but write only once.

                            Worse than meaningless name is misleading name.

                            It’s impossible to write clean and easily understandable code unless you are good at naming
                            variables, methods, classes, and anything else that you create which requires a name.

                            1. Do not use unnecessary, unclear abbreviations. Pronounceable names can be talked about
                            easily. Don't abbreviate unnecessarily.

                            3. Avoid using variables with short names. Exception are variables used for loops. Bu if you
                            use nested loops these variables are not recommended. You can also use subroutines instead
                            of nested loops.

                            4. A study by W. J. Hansen found that longer names are better for rarely used variables or global
                            variables and shorter names are better for local variables or loop variables (Shneiderman 1980)

                            indicate that you aren’t sure of their real pur- poses. - Code complete

                            Try to pass object instead creating polyadic functions

                            function name.

                            Also keep order consistent, so if you usually ask for $user_id as the first parameter,
                            keep it as the first parameter in future function definitions.

                            Two classes, components or modules are coupled when at least one of them uses the other. The
                            less these items know about each other, the looser they are coupled. A component that is only
                            loosely coupled to its environment can be more easily changed or replaced than a strongly

                            single class and classes of a component should have high cohesion. High cohesion in classes
                            and components results in simpler, more easily understandable code structure and design.

                            "Don't comment bad code - rewrite it." - B. Kernighan i Plaugher
                            Comments are, at best, necessary evil - Clean Code
                            We failed to express using code so we are using comments instead.
                            Every time you start to write a comment - think once more and try to make your code better.
                            They are often source of lie. That's because if you have a lot of comments you have to maintain
                            them as you maintain your .

                            Code should have comments, but having too much comments is as bad as too few. Comments discuss
                            why something is done but it' already explained in code - it DRY break

                            Speak about using PHPdoc and writing comments in files describing variables and methods
                            Speak about my preferable way of documenting even it is not pragmatic - writing doc block
                            for protected methods and variables and header in every file

                            Comments should only really be written when it’s not possible to clearly communicate the intent
                            of a variable or method by using a name. The comment then serves an actual purpose that could
                            not be easily expressed in the code. - simpleprogrammer.com/2015/03/16/11-rules-all-programmers-should-live-by/

                            If you believe that there is a valid case for a comment because the code performs something
                            really complicated or executes a very convoluted set of steps then your comment sounds like
                            an apology. Instead of fixing the issue, you chose to comment over it and move on. You need
                            to remember that the code you write is not only for compilers but for programmers too.
                            Eventually your code will become someone else's code and you will, in turn, inherit someone
                            else's work. If we all followed the same standards, then there would be no need to read
                            apologies and instead we would be enjoying improving and building upon the right foundations

                            Comments should state in high level terms what the expected result of the code is. Never
                            what the code is doing in low level terms.

                            1. For example do not write comments about information that can be found in source control
                            <br/>
                            2. Comments tend to be obsolete - comments easily become old, non appropriate
                            <br/>
                            3. For example - $i++ - increment i
                            <br/>
                            4. If you really want to write comment than let it be worth and good. Let it be clear.
                            <br/>
                            5. Add clutter to the code
                            <br/>
                            6. DO NOT leave commented out piece of code NEVER. Please never - if you do not do this it
                            will stay there forever. You will write it better next time trust me :-)

                            All this comments creates "noise". Even if there is a comment that could help you in
                            troubleshooting or fixing something, there is a very good chance that you will miss it
                            because it's obfuscated by the noise. - Source https://cmatskas.com/comments-in-code-yay-or-nay/

                            30 seconds rule - Another programmer should be able to look at the method, a class or an
                            interface definition. Programmer should understand what it does, why it does it and how it does
                            it in less than 30 seconds. This can be achieved if there is informative header documentation,
                            a name that clearly conveys the intent, by doing what it is supposed to - no more no less.

                        If you write clean code, then you are helping your future self and your co-workers. You are
                        reducing the cost of maintenance of the application you are writing. You are making it easier to
                        estimate the time needed for new features. You are making it easier to fix bugs. You are making
                        it more enjoyable to work on the code for many years to come. Essentially you are making the life
                        easier for everyone involved in the project. - Source - http://cvuorinen.net/2014/04/what-is-clean-code-and-why-should-you-care/

                        Try to write it as good as possible. Imagine you code is building. What happens with building
                        when you stop caring about it. The same happens to the code.

                        Some house was immaculate, beautiful, loaded with priceless antiques, objets d'art, and so on.
                        One day, a tapestry that was hanging a little too close to his living room fireplace caught on
                        fire. The fire department rushed in to save the day—and his house. But before they dragged
                        their big, dirty hoses into the house, they stopped—with the fire raging—to roll out a mat
                        between the front door and the source of the fire. They didn't want to mess up the carpet.
