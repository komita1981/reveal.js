                            Write a code like guy who will maintain it knows where you live and he is psyho
                            Treat your code as valuable member of the team. Like member of the management can screw
                            up - code can do it also if it is messy. Hiring an army of developer can't save you from
                            bad code. Try to write it as good as possible. Do not say to yourself I will do it next
                            time - LeBlanc's law says - Later equals never. Bad code is your mistake. Not managers -
                            only yours. It's your job to defend your code - like doctor who is washing his hands before
                            surgery. It takes time but it is your duty. Your job as professional is to say no. Defend
                            your profession, defend your code quality.
                            Deadline is not excuse. Making mess is very unprofessional.
                            If you make mess you will never reach that deadline.
                            The only way to go fast is to keep code clean as much as possible
                            all the time. Imagine you code is building. What happens with building when you stop caring
                            about it. The same happens to the code.
                            Code is getting worse as time passes. We should not wait - fix it all the time. That's
                            the only way you can prevent degradation.

                            Your managers actually want better code - they want to make it easier to develop new features

                            Take care about all parts of your application - bugs are often hidden in ignored parts

                            Entropy hits us hart. Entropy is amount of disorder in system.

                            Speak about broken window problem

                            Don't leave bad code behind you. Fix them as soon as you discover it. If you think there is
                            not enough time and that someone else will go around cleaning this mess - you are so wrong.
                            Don't let entropy wins - clean your code - clean it now

                            1. Testable system passes all tests and is completely tested. System that are not testable should
                            not be deployed because they can't be verified. Personal experience - when I started writing tests
                            I also started writing better code because I could not test bad code and when you write piece of
                            bad code and code that is not designed properly you will notice it immediately in your tests.
                            Encourage SRP and DIP. "The fact that we have these tests eliminates the fear that cleaning up
                            the code will break it". Good tests are also kind of good documentation

                            <br/>
                            3. Code should express all designs ideas that are in system. Think about maintenance - if your code
                            reveal your intent people who work after you on that code will spend less time. Some design patterns
                            solve this problem - Every time you duplicate your code you should create some kind of abstraction
                            Template, Strategy or Visitor pattern. Use if/else and switch case carefully

                        "It's OK to figure out murder mysteries, but you shouldn't need to figure out code. You should
                        be able to read it" - Steve C McConnell. It has story to tell.

                        It is much more profitable losing a couple of minutes thinking what is the best name for a
                        variable, or what is the best way to structure a class and get this extra time every time we
                        have to read it, than using the first name or structure that comes to mind in order to save time
                        having to spend it later trying to understand what a certain function does and how it does it.

                        Your code should read like a well-written story. The code should have a natural flow where each
                        method describes an operation that has an entry and exit point. Each method should add to the
                        overall story and written in such a way that it would make sense even to non-programmers

                        Someone cared about it
                        Design principles + Design patterns = Clean Code - IMPORTANT
                        “Clean code is code that has been taken care of. Someone has taken the time to keep it simple and
                        orderly. They have paid appropriate attention to details. They have cared.” But why should you care?
                        What’s wrong with code that just works? You should care because code is (almost) never written
                        just once and then forgotten. Most of the time you, or someone else, need to work on the code.
                        And to be able to work on it efficiently you need to understand the code. And because people
                        need to understand the code we write, we can say that the code we write is not intended
                        only for the computer but also for humans.

                        the codebase. This can be achieved if the person making the changes understands the code and
                        also feels confident that the changes introduced in the code do not break any existing
                        functionality.

                        your code efficiency.
                        As programmers, we seek to write code that not only does something, it does
                        something well. We refer to this "wellness" as efficiency. - Source https://www.drupal.org/node/328206

                        Not too smart
                        Clever is the enemy of clear.
                        Every time you look at an algorithm you just developed with the feeling you are the smartest
                        programmer you have ever met for doing something so complex and genius - write it again.

                        If your code is well design, clean and elegant than everyone will take care of it also. No one
                        will try to make mess in that code.

                        Tell story about fire in beautiful house - fireman care about house - they pout something
                        beneath hoses

                        Good code is solid, well written, tested and documented.

                        Your goal is to write beautiful, functional and verbose code. In the words of Uncle Bob "your
                        code should read like an article. There should be a beginning, middle and end, it should be
                        self-documenting and should follow a logical order. By using verbose and purposeful wording you
                        can ensure that your code is self-explanatory.

                        Knowledge<br/>

                        As developer we collect, organize and maintain knowledge. You have to learn basics of software
                        architecture and design patterns, follow good good practice and principles. You have to read a
                        lot, you have to read every day. Follow people with high knowledge, listen to them, read their books.
                        Go to conferences, speak about programming with your colleagues. Do it as often as it possible.
                        <br/><br/>

                        Hard work<br/>

                        It's like learning to ride bicycle from the book or learning to fight watching Bruce Lee movies.
                        It's impossible to learn to code just from to book. You learn all the time. As Uncle Bob Martin
                        said in his book "You must sweat over it". You have to write the code, you have to think about it,
                        you have to hate it, hate yourself because you fail. Head up, refactor your code, shine for the
                        moment, enjoy the fact that you are brilliant mastermind and yet again watch yourself failing.
                        Read your code, read other peoples code. Maybe someone is born with code-sense but most of the time
                        it's not. Talented football player is not the best football player. The best player is one who
                        trained a lot every day.

                            You can easily understand code if you choose names carefully.
                            Choosing good names takes time but it gives more value than it gets. Remember that
                            code is 10x more read than written.<br/><br/>
                            Readability is top priority
                            Code is written for humans to read and to be executed by machine. Machine will execute your code
                            but ask yourself - can human understand this
                            Read your when you finish writing - if it is funny or not clear to your colleagues
                            do refactoring.
                            When you read entity name you should not be surprised of it's responsibilities

                            Name should be meaningful

                            <br/><br/>

                            You will read code many many times but write only once.

                            Worse than meaningless name is misleading name.

                            It’s impossible to write clean and easily understandable code unless you are good at naming
                            variables, methods, classes, and anything else that you create which requires a name.

                            First rule is that functions should be small. The second is that should be smaller than that (Clean code)
                            Blocks within if-else and while statement should be one line long (Clean Code)
                            I also prefer this in all other loops
                            Functions should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only. (Clean Code)
                            Functions should not have side effects - do in functions only one thing - what name of that
                            function is - no more no less
                            If you use try-catch - than it should be the only one block in function
                            One level abstraction bellow name of the functions
                            You know you are working on clean code when each routine turns out to be pretty much what you expected
                            Long descriptive name is better than short enigmatic name, better than long descriptive comment
                            Choosing good nae is important - remember that you read 10x more than you write
                            The ideal number of params is 0 - niladic functions
                            Next come with 1 param - monadic
                            Followed by 2 - dyadic
                            3 - Triadic - should be avoided
                            4 and more params - Polyadic - Think about rewriting your function (T. Otwel)
                            Try to pass object instead creating polyadic functions

                            Side effects - do only one thing - described in name - not sudden effects

                            I mean Boolean flags create separate functions instead - when you set boolean value and than
                            decide what function will do.

                            2.<br/>
                            Do not use empty() - use name like isEmpty() - you should ask question
                            In Code complete author use names like found, done instead isFound, isDone because it's
                            easier to read in code

                            "Don't comment bad code - rewrite it." - B. Kernighan i Plaugher
                            Comments are, at best, necessary evil - Clean Code
                            We failed to express using code so we are using comments instead.
                            Every time you start to write a comment - think once more and try to make your code better.
                            They are often source of lie. That's because if you have a lot of comments you have to maintain
                            them as you maintain your .

                            Code should have comments, but having too much comments is as bad as too few. Comments discuss
                            why something is done but it' already explained in code - it DRY break

                            Speak about using PHPdoc and writing comments in files describing variables and methods
                            Speak about my preferable way of documenting even it is not pragmatic - writing doc block
                            for protected methods and variables and header in every file

                            Comments should only really be written when it’s not possible to clearly communicate the intent
                            of a variable or method by using a name. The comment then serves an actual purpose that could
                            not be easily expressed in the code. - simpleprogrammer.com/2015/03/16/11-rules-all-programmers-should-live-by/

                            If you believe that there is a valid case for a comment because the code performs something
                            really complicated or executes a very convoluted set of steps then your comment sounds like
                            an apology. Instead of fixing the issue, you chose to comment over it and move on. You need
                            to remember that the code you write is not only for compilers but for programmers too.
                            Eventually your code will become someone else's code and you will, in turn, inherit someone
                            else's work. If we all followed the same standards, then there would be no need to read
                            apologies and instead we would be enjoying improving and building upon the right foundations

                            4. If you really want to write comment than let it be worth and good. Let it be clear.
                            <br/>
                            5. DO NOT leave commented out piece of code NEVER. Please never - if you do not do this it
                            will stay there forever. You will write it better next time trust me :-)

                            All this comments creates "noise". Even if there is a comment that could help you in
                            troubleshooting or fixing something, there is a very good chance that you will miss it
                            because it's obfuscated by the noise. - Source https://cmatskas.com/comments-in-code-yay-or-nay/

                            Some developers spend more time debugging than writing new code. They should do this

                            doesn’t mean that you should try to make all of your variable names 9 to 15 or 10 to 16
                            characters long. It does mean that if you look over your code and see many names that are
                            shorter, you should check to be sure that the names are as clear as they need to be. - Code

                                Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the
                                code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.                            </q>

                            30 seconds rule - Another programmer should be able to look at the method, a class or an
                            interface definition. Programmer should understand what it does, why it does it and how it does
                            it in less than 30 seconds. This can be achieved if there is informative header documentation,
                            a name that clearly conveys the intent, by doing what it is supposed to - no more no less.

                        If you write clean code, then you are helping your future self and your co-workers. You are
                        reducing the cost of maintenance of the application you are writing. You are making it easier to
                        estimate the time needed for new features. You are making it easier to fix bugs. You are making
                        it more enjoyable to work on the code for many years to come. Essentially you are making the life
                        easier for everyone involved in the project. - Source - http://cvuorinen.net/2014/04/what-is-clean-code-and-why-should-you-care/
