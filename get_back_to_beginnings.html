                            Write a code like guy who will maintain it knows where you live and he is psyho
                            Treat your code as valuable member of the team. Like member of the management can screw
                            up - code can do it also if it is messy. Hiring an army of developer can't save you from
                            bad code. Try to write it as good as possible. Do not say to yourself I will do it next
                            time - LeBlanc's law says - Later equals never. Bad code is your mistake. Not managers -
                            only yours. It's your job to defend your code - like doctor who is washing his hands before
                            surgery. It takes time but it is your duty. Your job as professional is to say no. Defend
                            your profession, defend your code quality.
                            Deadline is not excuse. Making mess is very unprofessional.
                            If you make mess you will never reach that deadline.
                            The only way to go fast is to keep code clean as much as possible
                            all the time. Imagine you code is building. What happens with building when you stop caring
                            about it. The same happens to the code.
                            Code is getting worse as time passes. We should not wait - fix it all the time. That's
                            the only way you can prevent degradation.

                            Your managers actually want better code - they want to make it easier to develop new features

                            Take care about all parts of your application - bugs are often hidden in ignored parts

                            Entropy hits us hart. Entropy is ammount of disorder in system.

                            Speak about broken window problem

                            Dont leave bad code behind you. Fix them as soon as you discover it. If you think there is
                            not enough time and that someone else will go around cleaning this mess - you are so wrong.
                            Dont let entropy wins - clean your code - clean it now

                        Read 10x more than write. We are constantly reading old code. If you want to write code
                        more quickly that means that you have to make it more readable. Easy to read is easy to write.

                        If your code is well design, clean and elegant than everyone will take care of it also. No one
                        will try to make mess in that code.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Knowledge<br/>

                        You have to learn basics of software architecture and design patterns, follow good good practice
                        and principles. You have to read a lot, you have to read every day. Follow people with high
                        knowledge, listen to them, read their books. Go to conferences, speak about programming with your
                        colleagues. Do it as often as it possible.
                        <br/><br/>

                        Hard work<br/>

                        It's like learning to ride bicycle from the book or learning to fight watching Bruce Lee movies.
                        It's impossible to learn to code just from to book. You learn all the time. As Uncle Bob Martin
                        said in his book "You must sweat over it". You have to write the code, you have to think about it,
                        you have to hate it, hate yourself because you fail. Head up, refactor your code, shine for the
                        moment, enjoy the fact that you are brilliant mastermind and yet again watch yourself failing.
                        Read your code, read other peoples code. Maybe someone is born with code-sense but most of the time
                        it's not. Talented football player is not the best football player. The best player is one who
                        trained a lot every day.

                        You can easily understand code if you choose names carefully.
                        Choosing good names takes time but it gives more value than it gets. Remember that
                        code is 10x more read than written.<br/><br/>
                        Read your when you finish writing - if it is funny or not clear to your colleagues
                        do refactoring. <br/><br/>

                            Functions are verbs of every programming language and the classes are nouns (Clean Code)
                            Think about system as stories to be written. Functions need to fit cleanly together into a clear and
                            precise language to help you with that telling (Clean Code)

                            First is that functions should be small. The second is that should be smaller than that (Clean code)
                            Blocks within if-else and while statement should be one line long (Clean Code)
                            I also prefer this in all other loops
                            Functions should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only. (Clean Code)
                            Functions should not have side effects - do in functions only one thing - what name of that
                            function is - no more no less
                            If you use try-catch - than it should be the only one block in function
                            One level abstraction bellow name of the functions
                            You know you are working on clean code when each routine turns out to be pretty much what you expected
                            Long descriptive name is better than short enigmatic name, better than long descriptive comment
                            Choosing good nae is important - remember that you read 10x more than you write
                            The ideal number of params is 0 - niladic functins
                            Next come with 1 param - monadic
                            Followed by 2 - dyadic
                            3 - Triadic - should be avoided
                            4 and more params - Polyadic - Think about rewriting your function (T. Otwel)
                            Try to pass object instead creating polyadic functions
                            Do not use flags in functions - create separate functions instead

                    <h2>Refactoring</h2>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Start with bunch of code and than refactor

                        Adam Culp - “I write a novel and I make news article later in refactoring"

                        First write code that works - than do refactoring. Refine your code, split out functions,
                        make it dry, make it more readable
